# @ac-essentials/markdownlint-config

This package gives you a ready-to-use, shareable markdownlint configuration for Node.js and TypeScript projects. It's mainly for my own workflow, but you're welcome to use it if it fits your needs! The goal: keep markdown files clean, readable, and consistent across all your reposâ€”without having to copy-paste config everywhere.

## What does it do?

- Exports a markdownlint config (as JSON or JS) with a set of sensible rules and style preferences.
- Lets you enforce consistent markdown style in all your projects with almost zero setup.
- Makes it easy to update markdownlint rules everywhere at once.

## How do I use it?

1. **Install it:**

   ```sh
   yarn add -D @ac-essentials/markdownlint-config
   # or
   npm install --save-dev @ac-essentials/markdownlint-config
   ```

2. **Reference it in your `.markdownlint.json` or `.markdownlint.yaml`:**

   ```json
   {
     "extends": "@ac-essentials/markdownlint-config"
   }
   ```

   Or in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "config": "@ac-essentials/markdownlint-config"
   }
   ```

3. **Run markdownlint:**

   ```sh
   npx markdownlint .
   # or with markdownlint-cli2
   npx markdownlint-cli2 .
   ```

## Summary of Applied Options

### Default Rules (from markdownlint)

- Enforces consistent heading styles (ATX, no consecutive blank lines, etc.)
- Requires blank lines before/after headings and lists
- Disallows trailing spaces and hard tabs
- Requires fenced code blocks to use backticks
- Enforces ordered/unordered list style consistency
- Disables rules that conflict with common documentation practices (e.g., inline HTML allowed)

### Explicitly Set in This Config

- `MD013/line-length`: Disabled (no line length limit)
- `default`: Enabled (all other default rules are active unless overridden)

See the actual config file for the full list of enabled/disabled rules and their settings.
